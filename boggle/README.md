#Solving Boggle (Part 1)
Boggle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) is a word-finding game. The goal is to find as many words as possible in an NxN grid of letters.

###RULES
* Words must use adjacent tiles, including diagonals.
* Each word may not use a cube more than once.
* Words must be at least 3 letters long.
* Warning: The “Qu” tile counts as 2 letters. There is no raw “Q” tile.

An online solver is available at http://fuzzylogicinc.net/boggle/, if you want to play with it.

The task is to implement a solver for the game. Given a valid grid of letters and an arbitrary dictionary of words, return a list of contained words.

#Part 2
Use Jest and write tests for boggle.


#Part 3
Apply the feedback from code reviews
 - Focus on Readability.
    If your function and variable names make your code itself easy to read then you have less need for comments
 -
